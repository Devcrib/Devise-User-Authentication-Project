This is just an App with sign in/sign up functionality.

It does not follow any respectible coding practice per say.

When you want to mock up an Applicaton with login functionality and for some reason, you want the login/sign up form appearing as a modal, this is for you.

I am using Devise for Authentication and postgresql for the Database.

If you want this,
- Clone the git
- Bundle install
- rake db:create
- rake db:migrate

And You Are Done!.
